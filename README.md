Diagram of problem domain

We want to play a game of simplified Black Jack, wherein the user is dealt a hand of two cards from a standard deck of 52,
and is given the option to "hit" or "stay". The user may "git" as many times as he likes before chosing to "stay". The goal
is to score close to 21 without going over. Standard Black Jack card values.
